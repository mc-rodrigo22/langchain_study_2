### XZ Backdoor Overview

In February 2024, a malicious backdoor was introduced to the Linux build of the xz utility within the liblzma library in versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 by an account using the name "Jia Tan". The backdoor gives an attacker who possesses a specific Ed448 private key remote code execution capabilities on the affected Linux system. The issue has been given the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures number CVE-2024-3094 and has been assigned a CVSS score of 10.0, the highest possible score.

### Discovery and Impact

The backdoor was discovered by software developer Andres Freund, who announced his findings on March 29, 2024. Although xz is commonly present in most Linux distributions, at the time of discovery, the backdoored version had not yet been widely deployed to production systems but was present in development versions of major distributions, including Fedora Rawhide and Debian testing.

### Technical Details

The malicious code was introduced in updates that modified the way the xz utility functions, specifically targeting the SSH daemon (sshd). This backdoor allowed anyone with a predetermined encryption key to stash any code of their choice in an SSH login certificate, which could then be executed on the compromised device. The backdoor was designed to manipulate SSH authentication, potentially allowing unauthorized access to systems.

### Supply Chain Attack

This incident is considered a significant supply chain attack, as it involved the insertion of malicious code into a widely used open-source project. The attack was characterized by its sophistication, as it involved social engineering and manipulation of the development process to introduce the backdoor without immediate detection.

### Response and Mitigation

Following the discovery, various Linux distributions, including Red Hat and Debian, took steps to mitigate the risk by rolling back to earlier, unaffected versions of xz Utils. Users of affected systems were advised to check for the presence of the backdoored versions and take appropriate action.

### Conclusion

The XZ backdoor incident highlights the vulnerabilities inherent in open-source software development and the potential for malicious actors to exploit these systems. It serves as a reminder of the importance of vigilance in software supply chains and the need for robust security practices.
