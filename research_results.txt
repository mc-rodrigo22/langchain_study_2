Ruben Filipe Marques Amorim (born 27 January 1985) is a Portuguese professional football manager and former player who is the current head coach of Premier League club Manchester United.

As a footballer, Amorim played as a midfielder. He spent most of his professional career with Belenenses and Benfica, signing with the latter in 2008 and going on to win ten major titles, including three league titles, one Taça de Portugal, five Taças da Liga and one Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira. He represented Portugal in two FIFA World Cups, earning a total of 14 caps.

After retiring as a player in 2017, Amorim began his coaching career at Casa Pia in 2018, before resigning that same year amid a dispute with the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF). He was then appointed head coach at Braga's reserve team, popularly known as Braga B, before taking charge of the Braga senior side in December 2019, winning the 2020 Taça da Liga.

In March 2020, Amorim was appointed manager of Sporting CP, becoming then the third most expensive manager ever. In his first season, Amorim guided the club to a double by winning both the Taça da Liga and the Primeira Liga, ending the latter's 19-year league title drought. These achievements won him the Primeira Liga's Manager of the Year award for the 2020–21 season. He later led them to another Primeira Liga title in the 2023–24 season, being named for the second time Primeira Liga's Manager of the Year. He left the club for Manchester United in late 2024.
